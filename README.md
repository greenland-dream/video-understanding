**AI Scientist √ó Travel Blogger** ‚Äî an intelligent tool that addresses two major challenges: **managing large amounts of footage** and **producing creative content**. It's now open-source to assist every content creator!

This repository discloses the core code we use to manage large volumes of travel videos. It primarily achieves **video content understanding**, **automatic tagging**, and generating a concise **description for each video**. The project integrates multimodal models (including *deepseek Janus*, *mPLUG-owl3*, and *sensevoice*) and leverages large language models (either *deepseek* or *Qwen*) to produce more accurate descriptions and tags. It can then work together with tools like *Adobe Bridge* for video tagging, content search, and narration retrieval. Additionally, you can generate script outlines for platforms such as Rednote or Tiktok based on the descriptions.

## Features

- **Video Scene Understanding (Local Deployment)**  
  Analyze keyframes (I-frames) using *deepseek Janus* to extract static information such as scene context.

- **Full Video Understanding (Local Deployment)**  
  Use *mPLUG-owl3* to analyze the entire video's dynamic information, including people, objects, and scenes.

- **Audio Analysis (Local Deployment)**  
  Employ *sensevoice* for audio analysis and extracting dialogue, providing textual information for content summarization and tag generation.

- **Tag and Video Description Generation (via API)**  
  Based on multimodal information, call a large language model (*deepseek*/ *Qwen*) to generate tags, summaries, or descriptions.

- **Database Storage and Retrieval (Local Deployment)**  
  Use structured database (SQLite) and vector database (ChromaDB) to store video analysis results for efficient retrieval.

- **Natural Language Video Search (Local Deployment)**  
  Use query.py to implement natural language queries, finding the most matching videos through vector similarity search.

- **Web Interface Management and Search (Local Deployment)**  
  Provide a Flask-based web interface supporting video browsing, searching, previewing, and exporting.

- **Search and Management (Local Deployment)**  
  When combined with Adobe Bridge or similar tools, you can search for video clips by keywords.

- **Creative Content Production**  
  Combine video descriptions, tags, and extracted dialogue to generate viral script outlines for Rednote or Tiktok.

### **4. Natural Language Video Query**
Use query.py to search the video library using natural language:

```bash
python query.py "Help me find videos describing the Grand Canyon, with people walking, cloudy day, people admiring the beauty"
```

The system will return a list of the most matching videos, including similarity scores, video descriptions, and metadata information.

### **5. Web Interface Management**
Start the web interface for visual management:

```bash
cd web
python app.py
```

Web interface features include:
- View video library statistics
- Select folders for video processing
- Natural language video search
- Video preview and playback
- Export selected videos to a specified folder

### **5.1 CLIP Similarity Generation**
This feature analyzes a video by detecting scenes/clips and finding similar videos for each clip:

```bash
python tools/clip_similarity_finder.py --video_path /path/to/your/video.mp4 --output_dir /path/to/output
```

Key capabilities:
- Automatically detects scene changes in videos
- Analyzes audio, key frames, and motion in each clip
- Finds similar videos for each clip using multi-threading
- Ensures each similar video is only used once across all clips
- Organizes results in a clear directory structure
- Supports background information to guide video selection

Advanced options:
```bash
python tools/clip_similarity_finder.py --video_path /path/to/video.mp4 --output_dir /path/to/output --threshold 30 --min_duration 1.0 --max_threads 8 --background "Need European city style videos with warm tones"
```

### **5.2 Text Similarity Finder**
This feature finds videos that match text descriptions or instructions:

```bash
python tools/text_similarity_finder.py --text "Your text or instructions here" --output_dir /path/to/output
```

Key capabilities:
- Splits input text into meaningful segments
- Generates visual descriptions for each segment
- Finds similar videos for each description
- Can expand brief instructions into full video scripts
- Supports background information to guide video selection

Advanced options:
```bash
# Using a text file as input
python tools/text_similarity_finder.py --text_file /path/to/text_file.txt --output_dir /path/to/output

# Expanding an instruction with target duration
python tools/text_similarity_finder.py --text "Create a short video about spring" --is_instruction --target_duration 30 --output_dir /path/to/output

# With background information
python tools/text_similarity_finder.py --text "Cherry blossoms in bloom" --background "Need European city style videos with warm tones" --output_dir /path/to/output
```

## System Environment

Because *deepseek Janus* and *mPLUG-owl3* have some conflicting dependencies, this project is developed mainly under Janus's environment, with some additional packages installed. Meanwhile, *mPLUG-owl3* dependencies are installed in a **separate virtual environment** and invoked via `subprocess`.

- **Development & Testing Environment**  
  - Mac mini M4 Pro, 24GB Unified Memory  
  - Tested only on this configuration. If you need to run on a CUDA environment or a pure CPU environment, adjust parameters and paths in the code accordingly.
  
- **Deep Learning Dependencies**  
  - deepseek Janus
  - mPLUG-owl3
  - sensevoice
  - Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

- **Database Dependencies**
  - SQLite (structured data storage)
  - ChromaDB (vector database)
  - HuggingFace Embeddings (vector embeddings)

## Installation & Configuration

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/greenland-dream/video-understanding.git
cd video-understanding
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This project relies on multiple model environments. Please follow the steps below:

1. **Install Janus Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the `modules/Janus` directory and install Janus-related dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd modules/Janus
   pip install -e .
   cd ../..
   ```

2. **Install Main Project Dependencies**  
   In the main directory, install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install mPLUG-owl3 Dependencies**  
   Go to the `modules/mPLUG-Owl/mPLUG-Owl3` directory and install the `mPLUG-owl3` dependencies **in a separate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create -n owl3 python=3.9
   conda activate owl3
   cd modules/mPLUG-Owl/mPLUG-Owl3
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd ../../..
   conda deactivate
   ```

4. **Running the Project**  
   **The entire project is run under the Janus environment**. In other words, use the environment where Janus is installed to execute the main code, while `mPLUG-owl3` tasks will be invoked as a subprocess using `owl3`.

### 3. Configure Models & Environment

- Modify `config/model_config.yaml` to provide the path to your `mPLUG-owl3` virtual environment.
- Copy `config/api_configs.json.example` to `config/api_configs.json` and fill in the necessary API keys. Currently supports *deepseek*, *siliconflow*, *azure*, *github*, *openrouter*, *qwen* APIs. You can configure the priority of each API provider in `config/api_configs.json`, and the code supports dynamically switching among them.

### **4. Running Examples**

This project provides multiple ways to run:

#### 4.1 Video Processing (main.py)

1. **Open `main.py`:**  
   Replace "your_folder_path" with your video folder path, for instance:
   ```python
   folder_paths = [
       "/home/user/videos"  # e.g., your video folder
   ]
   ```

2. **Add a meta_data.txt File**  
   Inside the "/home/user/videos" folder, add a `meta_data.txt` file that contains a brief description (one sentence) of the videos' shoot time/location. For example:
   ```bash
   These videos were shot in December 2024 in the town of CONSUEGRA, Spain.
   ```

3. **Run the Python code**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The code will iterate through each folder listed in `folder_paths` and automatically process any videos within them.

#### 4.2 Video Query (query.py)

After processing videos, you can use natural language queries to search for videos:

```bash
python query.py "Help me find videos describing the Grand Canyon, with people walking, cloudy day, people admiring the beauty"
```

The system will return a list of the most matching videos, sorted by similarity.

#### 4.3 Web Interface (web/app.py)

Start the web interface for visual management:

```bash
cd web
python app.py
```

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to use the web interface.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**:
- You can add multiple folder paths to `folder_paths`; each folder must contain a `meta_data.txt`.
- Make sure the paths are formatted correctly, such as:
  - macOS/Linux: `"/Users/yourname/Videos"`
- Database files will be stored in the `db/data/` directory, including SQLite database and ChromaDB vector database.

## System Flowchart

The following flowchart illustrates the relationships and data flow between the three main entry points of the system:


This flowchart shows:

1. **Video Processing Flow (main.py)**: Processes videos by extracting audio, analyzing frames, generating descriptions and tags, and storing results in databases.

2. **Video Query Flow (query.py)**: Parses natural language queries, searches by description and transcript, and displays results to the user.

3. **Web Interface Flow (web/app.py)**: Provides a web interface for video statistics, processing, searching, streaming, and exporting.

The dotted lines represent connections between different modules, particularly how they all interact with the shared database.
