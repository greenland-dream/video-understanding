- Actions and behaviors of the main subjects

- Object movement and interaction  
- Information about people (whether they appear, their relation to the camera, distance, degree of facial close-up, role in the scene, whether they are aware of being filmed)

- Camera movement (static, pan, tilt, track, handheld, stabilized, etc.)

Ensure the information is accurate and comprehensive, capturing all details. Please provide a detailed answer for each part, without omitting or simplifyingâ€”give a complete analysis of all visible dynamic elements. DO NOT hypothesis any specific geographical location of the video.
